# Machine Learning Notebook
This is a collection of machine learning notebooks. The notebooks are written in Python and use the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library. The notebooks are designed to be run in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).
These notebooks are part of assignments in my degree in Data Science at the [IIT Madras](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds).
